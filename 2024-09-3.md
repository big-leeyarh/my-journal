# HTML-And-CSS-Full-Course
Intro To  HTML [HTML BASICS]: I learnt the full meaning of html which is hyper text markup language and i also learnt that to begin with it, we need to indtall 2 things. The 2 things are web browser and code editor. Examples of Web browsers are Google Chrome,Mozilla Firefox,Safari,Microsoft Edge,Opera,Internet Explorer,Tor Browser,Brave,Netscape Navigator e.t.c. But the most commonly used one is Google Chrome. While the examples of Code editor are Sublime Text,Visual Studio Code,Notepad++,Vim,Atom,PyCharm,UltraEdit,NetBeans,GNU Emacs. But the most commonly used editor is the Visual Studio Code.
I learnt some html tags like paragraph<p></p>, anchor elements<a></a> e.t.c
Anchor elements are elements basically used as a link to another website e.g [<a>link to youtube</a>] will not work on our web browser. Therefore we  will need  html syntax so as to be able to link to another website e.g <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">link to youtube </a>. This will then link us to youtube website. I also learnt about html attributes.They modify how an element behaves. Example of html attribute are href attributes and target attributes. Href attributes will determine where the link element will take us when we click on our browser.
NOTE:1. Dont forget to save any changes made in the code app. 2. When adding html attributes to tags add space to it. href is the attribute name while"https://www.youtube.com/" is the attribute value 
Target attributes determines wether the link opens in the current page. e.g:<a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="-blank"> link to youtube </a>. The -blank will let youtube open in a new tab. The target attributes and the href attributes only work on the link element <a></a>. While the button element<button></button> and paragraph element<p></p> have their own set of attributes. IN HTML,EXCESS SPACES ARE IGNORED 
INTRO TO CSS [CSS BASICS]: I learnt the full meaning of css which is cascading style sheet. Css syntax rules e.g buttons is a css selector which tells the computer which element on the page we are targetting with our css code. css property tells the computer that we are changing to the right of the colon while css value tells the computer what we are changing the property to.
the colon(:) is used to seperate the css property and css value while the semi colon(;) is just like a period in english. In english you end sentence with a period while in css, you end a style with a semicolon. In CSS, rgb is a combination of red, green and blue in which 255 is the highest frequency ratio.
